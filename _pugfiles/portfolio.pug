            p Robert Riordan is a fresh graduate of Webster Conservatory in St. Louis, MI. He is a very talented actor and singer just beginning to launch his exciting career.

            p Siq Liquid is a premium e-liquid manufacturer in Las Vegas, NV. It's also one of my old businesses. Never took off the way I hoped, but that's beside the point, I remade the website for practice and to gain experience in custom flex-box grids and responsive design.
